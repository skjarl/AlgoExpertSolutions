Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

Optimal solution is to iterate throught the input array. With each element, subtract it from the target number.  If the result is in the output dictionary, return the answer. If not, store that solution in the output dictionary and move on.  This approach works because if two of the numbers actually sum to the target, you'll get a hit when you check the second one in the output dictionary.
