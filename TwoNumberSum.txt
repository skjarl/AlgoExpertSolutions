Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an
integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum
up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any
order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return
an empty array.

Optimal solution is to iterate throught the input array. With each element, subtract it from the target number.  If the result is in the output array, return the answer. If not, store that solution in the output array and move on.
